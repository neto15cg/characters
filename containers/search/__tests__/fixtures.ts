        "Flash attended the same high school and university as Peter Parker, who would later be known as Spider-Man. He frequently bullied Peter but was actually Spider-Man's greatest fan. In time Flash befriended Peter, becoming a decorated war hero and was bonded to the Venom symbiote. Some time after losing the symbiote, Flash became the new Anti-Venom.",

His athletic prowess and phenomenal speed on the pitch earned him the nickname "Flash" and made him one of the most popular kids in the class. While his popularity made life easier at school, he had a difficult life at home. His father Harry—an alcoholic police officer—beat him regularly and derided Flash\'s athleticism despite his many accomplishments. Due to his rough life at home, Flash often took his anger out on other students who he felt were weak, such as "Puny" <a href="/spider-man/4005-1443/" data-ref-id="4005-1443"> Peter Parker</a>, who was one of his regular victims. While attending Midtown, Flash began dating <a href="/liz-allan/4005-15408/" data-ref-id="4005-15408"> Liz Allan</a>, who was the most popular girl in school. When Liz started to develop an attraction towards Peter, Flash became jealous and began targeting Parker with his bullying almost exclusively. After <a href="/spider-man/4005-1443/" data-ref-id="4005-1443"> Spider-Man</a> made his first appearance, however, Flash unknowingly became Parker\'s greatest—and sometimes only—fan.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Flash Thompson was created by Marvel artists <a href="/stan-lee/4040-40467/" data-ref-id="4040-40467"> Stan Lee</a> and <a href="/steve-ditko/4040-4026/" data-ref-id="4040-4026"> Steve Ditko</a> in 1962. He was first introduced into the comic world in the comic book <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/amazing-fantasy-15-spider-man/4000-105342/">Amazing Fantasy Vol.1 issue 15</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The University years</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-1562743" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1562743-1415603_336092_super.jpg" data-ratio="2.2610837438424" data-width="406" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 406px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:226.1%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1562743-1415603_336092_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1562743"><img alt="Sports Star" src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9541/1562743-1415603_336092_super.jpg" srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1562743-1415603_336092_super.jpg 406w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9541/1562743-1415603_336092_super.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px" data-width="283"></a><figcaption>Sports Star</figcaption></figure><p>After graduating from Midtown, Thompson enrolled at <a href="/empire-state-university/4020-43783/" data-ref-id="4020-43783"> Empire State University</a> on a sports scholarship. He rapidly developed a friendship there with fellow students <a href="/harry-osborn/4005-2478/" data-ref-id="4005-2478"> Harry Osborn</a> and <a href="/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/" data-ref-id="4005-1480"> Gwen Stacy</a>. In an unexpected attempt at inclusion, Flash tried to introduce Parker to Gwen and Harry, but Peter\'s mind was occupied with his <a href="/aunt-may/4005-1780/" data-ref-id="4005-1780"> Aunt May\'s</a> ailing health and he failed to introduce himself, ignoring them completely. Harry and Flash misinterpreted this as snobbery and felt slighted by the incident. Because of this, Peter continued to be a target of bullying from Flash and now Harry as well, who both repeatedly annoyed and picked at Peter. Despite this and because of Gwen\'s repeated attempts to befriend Peter, little by little, Parker became a part of Flash\'s circle. Flash also became friends with <a href="/mary-jane/4005-13380/" data-ref-id="4005-13380"> Mary Jane</a> who was Peter\'s best friend at the time and who he introduced to the group.</p><p>Before graduation, Flash suddenly decided to enroll in the army. The entire group, including Parker, were supportive of him and what they felt was a brave and noble decision. While stationed in South East Asia, he met Vietnamese native <a href="/sha-shan/4005-17635/" data-ref-id="4005-17635"> Sha Shan</a> and fell in love with her. When he later returned to New York, he bumped into Sha Shan in a restaurant. She refused to talk with him at first but Flash persisted until he learned the reason for her strange behavior. She had become a supervillain and enemy of Spider-Man known as "Sister Sun," a member of the <a href="/legion-of-light/4060-56633/" data-ref-id="4060-56633"> Legion of Light</a>. She\'d been forced into membership by her husband, Achmed Korba ( <a href="/brother-power/4005-34906/" data-ref-id="4005-34906"> Brother Power</a>). With the help of Spider-Man and <a href="/razorback/4005-6057/" data-ref-id="4005-6057"> Razorback</a>, Flash succeeded in liberating Sha Shan from her involvement with the Legion and her unhappy marriage, and she became Flash\'s girlfriend. Thompson\'s relationship with Sha Shan would not last, however. After a brief separation from her, Flash—buckling under mental stresses and behaving recklessly—began an affair with <a href="/betty-brant/4005-2484/" data-ref-id="4005-2484"> Betty Brant</a>. This would eventually lead to a permanent split with Sha Shan.</p><h3>Hobgoblin</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7475/167882-136284-flash-thompson.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-null" data-ratio="0" data-width="0" data-embed-type="image"><a  href="https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7475/167882-136284-flash-thompson.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-null"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7475/167882-136284-flash-thompson.jpg"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7475/167882-136284-flash-thompson.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>It was at this time that Flash boasted on live television that the villain <a href="/hobgoblin/4005-7605/" data-ref-id="4005-7605"> Hobgoblin</a> was a coward, igniting a rivalry with the costumed crook. <a href="/hobgoblin-kingsley/4005-7605/" data-ref-id="4005-7605"> Roderick Kingsley</a>, the current wearer of the Hobgoblin mantle, decided to take his revenge upon Flash for his brash words by convincing the public that Flash Thompson himself was Hobgoblin. Kingsley kidnapped and dressed Flash in a Hobgoblin costume, then brainwashed him into battling Spider-Man—a battle Flash lost easily as he lacked both powers and experience. Later, Hobgoblin weapons, costumes, and other incriminating items were found in his apartment, having been planted there by Kingsley. Kingsley\'s frame-up succeeded and Flash went to prison. While in prison, Flash was targeted by the <a href="/scourge/4005-14461/" data-ref-id="4005-14461"> Scourge of the Underworld</a>—a villainous group dedicated to killing costumed criminals who believed the accusations that he was the Hobgoblin—but Flash was saved by interference from Spider-Man and the real Hobgoblin. Flash later turned to Spider-Man for help and succeeded in cleaning his reputation.</p><h3>Coma</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13536/340438-183034-flash-thompson.PNG" data-ref-id="1300-null" data-ratio="0" data-width="0" data-embed-type="image"><a  href="https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13536/340438-183034-flash-thompson.PNG" data-ref-id="1300-null"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13536/340438-183034-flash-thompson.PNG"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13536/340438-183034-flash-thompson.PNG"></noscript></a></figure><p>The price for that victory, however, was high. Flash had injured his arm during a battle against a different Hobgoblin, <a href="/hobgoblin/4005-26374/" data-ref-id="4005-26374"> Jason Macendale</a>, which resulted in his football career coming to an end. No longer in a relationship with Betty Brant and lacking job opportunities, Flash fell into alcoholism. Surprisingly, it was <a href="/norman-osborn/4005-58812/" data-ref-id="4005-58812"> Norman Osborn</a> who succeeded in turning Flash back on the path to sobriety, however as the Green Goblin, Osborn also tried to destroy Flash’s respect for Spider-Man. Norman failed at this and decided to kill Flash instead, concealing the murder as an accident involving alcohol. Flash survived this attempt on his life, but was put into a coma.</p><h3>Spider-Man: The Other</h3><p>When Flash awoke from his coma, he became a gym teacher at his old high school, Midtown High. He was suffering from severe memory loss, however, and this resulted in him returning to old habits such as bullying Peter, who was also working at Midtown as a science teacher. When Parker\'s identity of Spider-Man was publicly announced during the events of the superhero <a href="/civil-war/4045-40615/" data-ref-id="4045-40615"> Civil War</a>, Flash did not believe it and thought that he Parker just protecting Spider-Man\'s real identity. He even challenged Peter to dodge ball, but got knocked out since Peter—unaware of Flash\'s memory troubles—thought he didn\'t have to hold back with his powers. Flash was rushed into the clinic where he flirted with the nurse, <a href="/miss-arrow/4005-41738/" data-ref-id="4005-41738"> Miss Arrow</a>. Flash finally believed that Peter was Spider-Man when he saw him protecting the students from the villains that were taking up the name of <a href="/mephisto/4005-2635/" data-ref-id="4005-2635"> Mephisto</a>. Flash was later kidnapped by Miss Arrow—who was actually an evil counterpart of Spider-Man\'s composed of shape-changing Ero or "pirate" spiders—when she chose him to be her "mate and sustenance," but later simply wanted to kill him because she saw Spider-Man as a more powerful candidate.</p><h3>Military career</h3><p>Years later, having recovered from the coma and spent time working as a high school gym teacher, Flash rejoined the military. It was during a tour of duty in Iraq that Flash\'s squad was ambushed. Flash afforded himself courageously and saved the life of his commanding officer, but sustained grievous injuries to his legs, becoming a double-amputee. Flash\'s old circle of friends, including Parker and even ex-girlfriend Sha Shan, helped Flash deal with his loss. During his recovery Flash reignited his relationship with Betty Brant.</p><h3><b>Brand New Day and One More Day</b></h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2137497-flash_thompson_amazing_spider_man_extra_3_edited.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-null" data-ratio="0" data-width="0" data-embed-type="image"><a  href="https://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2137497-flash_thompson_amazing_spider_man_extra_3_edited.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-null"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2137497-flash_thompson_amazing_spider_man_extra_3_edited.jpg"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2137497-flash_thompson_amazing_spider_man_extra_3_edited.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Following the events of <i>Brand New Day</i>, Flash—now crippled from injuries he sustained while serving the military—attended a party being thrown by Parker\'s circle of friends for <a href="/harry-osborn/4005-2478/" data-ref-id="4005-2478"> Harry Osborn</a>. Just like everyone else, Flash did not seem to remember that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Though Peter and Flash were portrayed as friends, he did occasionally give Peter a hard time. Flash confided to Peter that Spider-Man was his inspiration while fighting in Iraq, so much so that he risked his life to help save his platoon. After protecting his platoon from an ambush Flash selflessly rescued his commanding officer by dragging him out of rubble rather than wait for reinforcements and medical assistance. His act of heroism cost Flash his legs but he was awarded for his courage with the congressional medal of honor. To keep active, Flash became very involved with wheel chair sports like wheelchair basketball and racing. When Peter Parker lost his job suddenly, he attempted to earn some quick money by selling embarrassing photos of Spider-Man. Angry about this portrayal of his hero, Flash wheeled himself over to Peter\'s apartment and yelled for him to come out to fight him since the building is not handicap accessible. While the two didn\'t come to violence, they traded insults and Flash lost some of the respect he\'d developed for Peter. Flash continued to heal during this time—both physically and emotionally—going through rehabilitation under the care of his old flame, <a href="/sha-shan/4005-17635/" data-ref-id="4005-17635"> Sha Shan</a>, who generously offered to serve as his physical trainer.</p><h3><b>Birth of A New Venom</b></h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-1624755" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64293/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg" data-ratio="1.5188888888889" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 900px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:151.9%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64293/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1624755"><img alt="Venom (Flash Thompson)" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" data-width="421" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64293/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg" data-srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/64293/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64293/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64293/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg 421w"><noscript><img alt="Venom (Flash Thompson)" src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64293/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg" srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/64293/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64293/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64293/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg 421w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" data-width="421"></noscript></a><figcaption>Venom (Flash Thompson)</figcaption></figure><p>During the <a href="/siege-storming-asgard-heroes-villains/4050-31275/" data-ref-id="4050-31275"> Siege of Asgard</a> <a href="/mac-gargan/4005-4484/" data-ref-id="4005-4484"> Mac Gargan</a> is separated from the <a href="/venom/4005-1486/" data-ref-id="4005-1486"> Venom</a> symbiote (later becoming the Scorpion once again). The symbiote fall into the possession of the US government and was contained in a secret government base controlled by the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS was inclined to use the symbiote to create a new super-powered soldier to help protect the country. After trying and failing to bond the symbiote with another host, resulting in the candidate\'s death, the government decided to approach another candidate. Around this time Flash was approached by the Department of Homeland Security as a candidate to be bonded with the parasitic alien in order to create a new super soldier. Flash agreed and became Agent Venom, controlling the suit with a combination of sedatives and strength of will. The Government put strict limits on Flash\'s role as Venom, telling him that he would only be allowed to serve as Venom for twenty missions in total—that after he had served his time he would never be allowed contact with the symbiote again. This rule was intended to prevent the development of addictive behavior regarding use of the suit. Given drugs to control the symbiote and suppress its personality, Flash Thompson became one of the government\'s covert men in the battle against evil. While having the abilities of Spider-Man—amplified even beyond Parker\'s strength levels—Flash Thompson set out to simply survive all twenty missions without surrendering control to the Venom symbiote.</p><p>Flash\'s first mission sent him to the nation of Nrosvekistan. He was assigned to find Doctor <a href="/doctor-ferid-ekmecic/4005-82733/" data-ref-id="4005-82733"> Ferid Ekmecic</a> and capture him. While on the mission he discovered a woman and her baby who had wandered into the line of fire. He saved the pair by leading them to safety, but just when he was about to capture the doctor he encountered the new <a href="/jack-olantern/4005-40901/" data-ref-id="4005-40901"> Jack O\' Lantern</a> who then incapacitated him and escaped with the doctor while Flash gave pursuit. While fighting Jack, Flash began to lose control of the suit, but while the villain had him pinned to the ground Flash managed to throw a live grenade into his mask, blowing his jaw off. Jack survived this and attempted to complete his mission by escaping with the doctor. As Jack was flying away, Flash made the decision to kill the doctor by snapping his neck with webbing. When Flash returned to base, his commanding officer General Dodge dressed him down for losing control of the suit. Later, when Flash finally made it back home, he found Betty Brant in tears, having waited for him for six hours late for a date they\'d planned together. With Flash being unable to explain his whereabouts and tardiness due to the secrecy of his status as Venom, Betty assumed that he was drinking again and slammed the door in his face.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30334/1894456-mu7787.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-null" data-ratio="0" data-width="0" data-embed-type="image"><a  href="https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30334/1894456-mu7787.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-null"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30334/1894456-mu7787.jpg"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30334/1894456-mu7787.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Flash next appeared on the run from <a href="/kraven-the-hunter/4005-2475/" data-ref-id="4005-2475"> Kraven The Hunter</a> in the <a href="/savage-land/4020-21766/" data-ref-id="4020-21766"> Savage Land</a>. Despite being poisoned, he continued his mission to stop a shipment of illicit Antarctic <a href="/vibranium/4055-40919/" data-ref-id="4055-40919"> Vibranium</a>, a dangerous and valuable metal. Disoriented and unable to locate Kraven, Flash took refuge in a cave, where he tried to figure out how long he\'d even been in the Savage Land. While in this cave he once again crossed paths with Kraven and the two resumed their fight. While fighting, Kraven woke giant bats that resided in the cave and their powerful hypersonic screeching separated Flash from the symbiote. This left Flash momentarily at Kraven\'s mercy, but he was saved when the bats swarmed the two humans, dragging Flash and Kraven both into the sky. Flash used the last of his ammunition to shoot the bat and grabbed onto a ledge to keep from falling to his death. While Flash was on the ground recovering, he was convinced that he will still die from the poison when the symbiote located him and rebonded with Thompson, telling him that it needs him and knows he needs it. Elsewhere, the <a href="/crime-master-brant/4005-85181/" data-ref-id="4005-85181"> new</a> <a href="/crime-master-brant/4005-85181/" data-ref-id="4005-85181"> Crime Master</a> and Jack O\' Lantern used surveillance to capture images of Flash when he was separated from the symbiote, putting his identity in jeopardy.</p><p>Jack O\'Lantern put this information to use by kidnapping Betty Brant. Flash, still in the Savage Land, had lost all control of the symbiote. Although he contineud to pursue his mission objectives, he slaughtered numerous henchmen guarding the vibranium and blew up the entire installation once he\'d hijacked the helicopter carrying the shipment of vibranium. When Flash attempted to contact his home base, he instead received a message from Jack O\' Lantern showing Betty as a hostage, offering to exchange her for the vibranium. Conflicted and still struggling to contain the symbiote\'s personality, Flash flew the helicopter back to New York City and delivered the metal to the criminals. Crime Master allowed him 5 minutes to get to Betty Brant, who was being held in a warehouse rigged with explosives. On his way to save Betty he was intercepted and subdued by Spider-man, who has just recently learned of Betty\'s capture and suspected Venom\'s involvement.</p><p>In his desperation to save Betty, Flash lost all control of the suit. With the Venom persona fully in control, his hatred for Spider-man took over and the two fought bitterly, wasting precious time needed to save Betty. Seeing his loss of control, the government made an attempt to detonate Thompson with explosives implanted in him as a safety precaution, but this fails as the suit had secretly removed this device and planted it on one of Crime Master\'s henchmen. After a long battle, Flash managed to wrest enough control from the symbiote to retreat and locate a pharmacy where he could locate some sedatives to assist in controlling Venom. He then resumed his attempt to rescue Betty, but failed to get to the building on time. Thankfully, Spider-man had already rescued her, having gone there directly after disengaging from his fight with Venom. During debriefing, Thompson reminded his team that despite his temporary loss of control, he is still one of the good guys and he was able to control the suit in the end.</p><h3><b>Spider-Island</b></h3><p>Just before the spider infection began to spread across New York City, Flash\'s father was put in the hospital, bedridden due to cirrhosis of the liver. Flash\'s father begged to talk to his son, but Flash left when was called into action as Agent Venom to deal with the developing crisis.</p><p>Flash reported to a bridge on the Hudson river in order to stop <a href="/captain-america/4005-1442/" data-ref-id="4005-1442"> Spider-King</a>—one of the <a href="/queen/4005-41418/" data-ref-id="4005-41418"> Queen\'s</a> henchmen—from spreading the infection to New Jersey.

After waking up and escaping, Spider-King caused havoc in the base and almost killed Flash, but General Dodge\'s dog Samson bonded with the venom symbiote temporarily and saved him.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2064417" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31103/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png" data-ratio="1.9753086419753" data-width="405" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 405px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:197.5%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31103/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png" data-ref-id="1300-2064417"><img alt="Samson-Venom!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" data-width="324" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31103/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png" data-srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31103/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png 405w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31103/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png 324w"><noscript><img alt="Samson-Venom!" src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31103/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png" srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31103/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png 405w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31103/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png 324w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" data-width="324"></noscript></a><figcaption>Samson-Venom!</figcaption></figure><p>Flash then rejoined with the symbiote and defeated Spider-King a second time. After managing to contain Spider-King and reveal his identity as Steve Rogers, Captain America, Flash was ordered to use the symbiote\'s camouflage powers to mimic Spider-King\'s appearance and infiltrate the Queen\'s base, ultimately to kill the leader herself. Flash was about to kill the Queen as Spider-King when it was revealed by a clone of <a href="/jackal/4005-10974/" data-ref-id="4005-10974"> Miles Warren</a>, the Jackal, that <a href="/eddie-brock/4005-6733/" data-ref-id="4005-6733"> Anti-Venom</a>, former host of the Venom symbiote <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/eddie-brock/4005-6733/" data-ref-id="4005-6733">Eddie Brock</a>, was curing desperate vagrants in the "Our Lady Of Saints" Church. After the Queen killed the clone, she ordered Spider-King to go and kill Anti-Venom. Flash left immediately, contacting <a href="/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/" data-ref-id="4005-2151"> Reed Richards</a> of the <a href="/future-foundation/4060-57552/" data-ref-id="4060-57552"> Future Foundation</a> to inform him that a cure for the spider plague existed. Coordinating with General Dodge and Project Rebirth 2.0, Flash received updated orders to capture Anti-Venom so that Reed and <a href="/horizon-labs/4020-57110/" data-ref-id="4020-57110"> Horizon Labs</a> could make a cure to the spider-infection based on his suit\'s properties.</p><p>After a long confrontation with Anti-Venom, the symbiote attempted to rejoin with Eddie Brock, weakening the Anti-Venom suit enough to actually join with Brock for a brief moment. However, Flash reminded the symbiote that Eddie would always fight it now and that Flash still needs it. The symbiote left Eddie and rejoined Flash, allowing Anti-Venom\'s suit to heal while Flash transported him to Richards\' location. Flash left Anti-Venom at Horizon Labs where Brock readily agreed to allow Mr. Fantastic to work on using his suit to develop a cure for the infected. Flash then returned to the hospital to visit his father and they both reminisced about the positive memories they shared of listening to records together in their old basement. Flash told his father that, despite their difficulties, he wouldn\'t have picked anyone else to be his dad. Then Flash\'s father passed away in front of him.</p><p>Betty offered to stay by Flash\'s side in his moment of grief and handed him a letter his father had asked her to transcribe for him before Flash made it back to the hospital. However, as the infection was getting worse, Flash felt it was his duty to continue the fight against the Queen\'s forces. He gave Betty his fully loaded service pistol, and left her at the hospital, telling her that he was going to find an evacuation point so they can both escape. In reality, Flash rejoined the fray as Venom, seeking to assassinate The Queen. In the attempt, however, he is pushed back by her sonic scream attack, which the symbiote is vulnerable to. Steve Rogers himself came to his Flash\'s aid and the two managed to put her down briefly, Flash using Cap\'s shield to deliver what they both believe to be a mortal blow. Although the Queen then transformed into a giant Spider form, Flash continued to aid in the battle until she was ultimately killed by the rejuvenated clone of Peter Parker, Kaine.</p><p>After the Queen\'s death, New York was in chaos. All the spider-people had turned back to normal, but had lost their clothes in the process. <a href="/damage-control/4060-4951/" data-ref-id="4060-4951"> Damage Control</a> took care of the problem, but in the middle of this, an old villain called The <a href="/hijacker/4005-14454/" data-ref-id="4005-14454"> Hijacker</a> decided that this was his chance to make one last big score and quit for life. He used a giant tank to rob several banks, and he didn\'t bother to stop for civilians. Flash, still looking for Betty, found The Hijacker and was told to take him down. Flash witnesses Hijacker\'s tank run over a security guard, followed by a mother and child. This causes Flash to lose control, and he fakes his own death by allowing the tank to run him over. When Hijacker returns to his lair to inspect the cash, Flash emerges, enraged. As Venom, he viciously mauls Hijacker, breaks his fingers, and bites his head off and spits it out. Flash decides to head home. Although Flash had lost his father\'s letter in the fighting, he met with Betty later that day in their apartment. She had safely locked herself in a utility closet when she succumbed to the spider infection\'s transformation effects. She revealed that she still had a copy of the letter she\'d penned out in shorthand. Sitting together in their first peaceful moment together since Spider-Island began, she read his father\'s last words to Flash out loud to him.</p><h3>Minimum Carnage</h3><p>Flash is sent to find and bring in Carnage, whom has kidnapped the reporter, <a href="/katy-kiernan/4005-29742/" data-ref-id="4005-29742"> Katy Kiernan</a>. He tracks him from Colorado and eventually follows him to Houston, Texas where encounters the new <a href="/kaine/4005-8667/" data-ref-id="4005-8667"> Scarlet Spider</a>, Kaine. They hold each at a standstill with Kaine about to stab Flash in a moment of anger. Flash loses control of the symbiote for an unknown reason as it returns to its original Venom form and attacks the Scarlet Spider. Kaine does his best to defend himself but cannot seem to slow Venom down until Flash regains control. He asks Kaine to follow him into the <a href="/microverse/4020-43832/" data-ref-id="4020-43832"> Microverse</a> where Carnage went. Flash and Kaine head into the Microverse together. Flash wakes up and is attacked by some sonic screaming pixies but he is saved by a group of people and they ask for his help. Flash ends up losing control of the symbiote again, as the saviors revealed to be a called the <a href="/the-enigma-force/4060-57600/" data-ref-id="4060-57600"> Enigma Force</a> try to stop it. Ironically, a sonic pixie is what calms it down by whistling. Venom is eventually captured along with Carnage where it is revealed the symbiotes were once a cancer to the Enigma Force power and were defeated and expelled from the Microverse.</p><p>Marquis Radu wants to create an army of the symbiotes once more to kill the Redeemer, or real god of the Microverse and possessor of the Enigma Force, and take the force for himself. Marquis Radu wants to create an army of symbiotes and use them to defeat the Redeemer where he will reshape the Microverse than attack the Macroverse. Radu succeeds in using Venom and Carnage to create a hybrid symbiote army. Venom manages to get free from his shackles where he faces off against and Carnage becomes more brutal in his offense manipulating solid and sharp constructs to match carnage. He continues to fight against his symbiote\'s child and the hybrids before Kaine shows up to help along with the Redeemer. Flash figures out the hybrids can be controlled from the parental symbiotes and tries to connect but fails at first. He realizes he must reawaken Venom\'s own mind and channel the symbiote. In doing so, he manages to defeat the hybrids and Carnage, but Carnage himself escapes by sinking into the floor and is dispelled from the Microverse.</p><p>Katy, Kaine, and Flash are sent back to Houston where they encounter a restored Carnage. The duo manage to defeat Carnage and when Kaine tried to kill him, Flash stopped him. Venom was told that the human side of Carnage has been effectively lobotomized but the symbiote remains, leaving Carnage in a catatonic state due to sedation but more dangerous than ever.</p><h3>The Evil Inside Us All and Moving to Philadelphia</h3><p>After the events in Minimum Carnage, Flash tracks down a group of devil-worshipers and defeated them. Afterwards, he talks to <a href="/hellstorm/4005-14695/" data-ref-id="4005-14695"> Daimon Hellstorm</a>, who gave Flash the clue to where the worshipers were hiding. Flash starts to reflect on his life and the consequences of the choices he made, both in his school years and now with the symbiote. After a talk with Peter Parker Flash learns that A.J. Patton, a victim of Flash bullying in his school years, has moved back to the city. Flash seeks out A.J. to apologize for his past behavior, A.J. tells Flash it is all in the past. But Flash overhears a conversation between A.J. and his boyfriend and learns that he scared A.J. for life and gave him night terror.</p><p>At night Flash seemingly controlled by the symbiote wreaks terror on one of the devil-worshipers and also on his own mother, scaring them out of their own minds. A pentagram is clearly visible on the symbiote and the demon trapped inside Venom is starting to wake up. Latter Flash talks to Peter Parker and ask him if he really was that bad in their school years. Peter tells Flash that he made school a living hell for many of the students and made them not want to go to school. Flash tells Peter that because of all the recent events and his past he is going to move away. Flash heads to Philadelphia where he defeats the U-Foes with help from Valkyrie and the demon inside.</p><p>Flash makes the official move to Philly, where he owns a new apartment and works as an assistant gym coach at the high school, while also becoming the Philadelphia\'s version of Spider-Man. He encounters a strange creature that has been murdering and eating people and animals alike throughout town. Flash defeats it but the creature manages to run away. Flash continues to struggle fitting in his new life and even attends an alcohols anonymous meeting. While on patrol, he encounters the cannibal creature and ends up restraining him before getting surprised by the returning Eddie Brock, a.k.a. <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/toxin/4005-40783/" data-ref-id="4005-40783">Toxin</a>. Venom begins his return match against Toxin. The two have a brutal fight with Flash holding his own, but he can\'t overcome the superior symbiote. The cannibal creature jumps in to attack Toxin, but he is killed by him. Flash almost succeeds in killing him, but the symbiote manages to hold him together and Flash only turns the tide by injecting Toxin with the sedative used for his symbiote. Flash ends up escaping and gets to his home in a battered state. His student Andi offers to help him, but he yells at her to go away so he doesn\'t form any ties with people so they don\'t get hurt.</p><p>Flash returns to work the next day, but Eddie Brock shows up in order to finish what they started the previous night. The viral aliens similar to the creature they faced during their fight ended up infecting more humans and attacking the school in order to kill Venom and Toxin. Flash manages to get the students to safety and then both Venom and Toxin battle the symbiote slayers. Toxin begins to get overwhelmed but Flash allows the symbiote to assume natural form and becomes full on Venom and saves Toxin and the two finish off the slayers. Eddie is ready to fight Flash then and there, but Flash resumes control and tells Brock he has to control the urges as he is trying to form a life. Brock agrees to let him live, but when the day comes Flash loses control he will kill to which Flash agrees. The students end up safe and Flash gets interviewed by a news team and tells them that the symbiote creature, in regards to Toxin, saved the school.</p><p>Flash goes through the week busting what he thought was a drug cartel in order to find their leader. He eventually finds the leader named Lord Ogre, and Flash fights off his guard dogs. Lord Ogre manages to escape but when Flash starts to chase after them, he checks one of the cartel\'s vans and finds a bunch of captives in there.</p><p>While at work, Flash is approached by Katy Kiernan who knows he was present when Venom and Toxin saved the school from the symbiote slayers. He dismisses her, telling her that he did not see everything because he locked himself up for protection. Later, Venom is being attacked by several villains, like <a href="//www.comicvine.com/constrictor/4005-2127/" data-ref-id="4005-2127">Constrictor</a> and <a href="//www.comicvine.com/lord-deathstrike/4005-78027/" data-ref-id="4005-78027">Lord Deathstrike</a> as Lord Ogre put a bounty on his head. Flash realizes he needs some help and contacts Katy for a meeting so she can help set him up with various resources.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/149570/3213763-img_6774.png" data-ref-id="1300-3213763" data-ratio="1.5" data-width="640" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 640px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/149570/3213763-img_6774.png" data-ref-id="1300-3213763"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" data-width="426" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/149570/3213763-img_6774.png" data-srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/14/149570/3213763-img_6774.png 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/149570/3213763-img_6774.png 426w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/149570/3213763-img_6774.png" srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/14/149570/3213763-img_6774.png 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/149570/3213763-img_6774.png 426w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" data-width="426"></noscript></a></figure><p><strong>Jack Returns</strong></p><p>Flash is incognito as an elderly woman as he meets with Katy as to not draw attention. Flash continues to fight off the countless contracts that Lord Ogre has sent after him, all the while meeting with Katy\'s resources and allies to establish his own network around the city. Flash intervenes as <a href="//www.comicvine.com/jack-olantern/4005-40901/" data-ref-id="4005-40901">Jack O\'Lantern</a> is chasing Andi and about to hurt her and her father. Flash and him fight, but Jack manages to slip out of Venom\'s grip and mortally stab Andi\'s father in the chest. Flash snaps and attacks even fiercer than before. Jack attempts to kill Andi with poison bombs, but Flash extends the symbiote to Andi to attempt to filter the poison. But something unexpected happens as part of the symbiote instead bonds to Andi, transforming her into <a href="/andi-benton/4005-90267/" data-ref-id="4005-90267">Mania</a>.</p><p>Flash and the newly possessed Andi manage to defeat Jack. The pumpkin head soon breaks, revealing that the Jack underneath was someone else that just happened to have been hypnotized with all of the previous Jack\'s memories and abilities. The new Jack escapes, causing Andi and Flash to follow him where they are led into a trap with all of the assassins gunning for them. Andi almost kills the fake Jack for killing her father, but Flash talks her out of it. The two then web up the remaining assassins. Flash keeps in touch with Andi after she moved in with her aunt. The separation gives Flash time to think about how Andi became so adept at using the symbiote so fast.</p><h3>Thunderbolts</h3><p>Flash is on a mission in Somalia where he is approached by <a href="/thunderbolt-ross/4005-3457/" data-ref-id="4005-3457">General Thunderbolt Ross</a> who asks Flash to join his new <a href="/thunderbolts/4060-23977/" data-ref-id="4060-23977">Thunderbolts</a>.</p><h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916159-7604233426-56378.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-5916159" data-ratio="0.56276595744681" data-width="940" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 940px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916159-7604233426-56378.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-5916159"><img alt="Agent Venom as a cosmic hero" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5916159-7604233426-56378.jpg" data-srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916159-7604233426-56378.jpg 940w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5916159-7604233426-56378.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Agent Venom as a cosmic hero" src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5916159-7604233426-56378.jpg" srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916159-7604233426-56378.jpg 940w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5916159-7604233426-56378.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Agent Venom as a cosmic hero</figcaption></figure><p>Tony Stark later asks Flash to join the <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/" data-ref-id="4060-25956">Guardians of The Galaxy </a>as a representative of the Avengers in space.

Using the remaining symbiote particles in his bloodstream as a tracker, Flash tracks Venom to <a href="/alchemax/4060-57269/" data-ref-id="4060-57269">Alchemax Tower</a>, where he finds that it has once again bonded with Eddie Brock. A fight ensues, with Flash trying to get the symbiote to return to him. Unable to choose which host to bond with, the Venom instead symbiote envelops both men. Just then, Spider-Man arrives to help, and overturns a vat of the serum Alchemax developed onto the symbiote, hoping it will kill the organism once and for all.</p><p>However, rather than killing Venom, the serum causes the portion of the creature that was covering Flash to invert its colors. With his new, white symbiote outfit, Flash decides to dub himself Anti-Venom, the name Eddie Brock had used in the past after gaining his own inverted version of the Venom symbiote. </p><h2>Powers</h2><p>As Venom, Flash has all the abilities of a Spider-Man including enhanced strength, speed, wall-crawling, and—unlike the original Spider-Man—he can generate his own webbing from his wrist. He is strong enough to engage Carnage in combat and tear the turret off a tank. He is also fast enough to dodge bullets from machine guns. He can also generate tendrils from the suit to hold multiple weapons, such as machine guns. He is also able to use the shape-changing properties of the suit in order to create bladed weapons similar to Carnage, and create disguises for himself, such as an <a href="/aim/4060-13497/" data-ref-id="4060-13497"> A.I.M.</a> agent\'s uniform.

After Peter becomes angrier and more easily agitated from being bonded with the Venom symbiote, it is Flash that snaps Peter back into reality by reminding him that his friends only want to help. Flash later shows his more heroic side when he and his friends help save Gwen Stacy from falling to her death at the Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p><p>In "First Steps" it is revealed that he and Peter were best friends in Nursery School. Peter also gave Flash his trademark nickname because of his tendency to streak as a little boy.
